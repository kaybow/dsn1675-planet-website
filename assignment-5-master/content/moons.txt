Discovery of Venus’s Moons

Venus is always brighter than the brightest stars outside our solar system.

Well Venus doesn’t actually have moons—unless we haven’t discovered them yet—so here’s some other details. Venus is always brighter than any star (apart from the Sun). The greatest luminosity, apparent magnitude −4.9, occurs during crescent phase when it is near Earth. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun. The planet is bright enough to be seen in a mid-day clear sky, and it can be easy to see when the Sun is low on the horizon. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.
